# Canonical-Toolchain
A template for the TERMINUS program's various RP2040/RP2350 architecture based RTIC applications

## This is a minimum example for the RP2040 on a Pi Pico, RP2350 Support is planned but not yet tested

After you have cloned that, you should be able to run our software!

Cheers!
